    "whyLimonfyShowMoreAddsExplanation" :"The question must arise from the premise 'Why don't you show more ads to cover the cost of a Premium membership?' Although it is possible, the number of ads that should be shown is high, and to avoid having a bad experience, it is better we offer a membership with the lowest possible cost."
